=TITLE class Perl6::Documentable::Search

=SUBTITLE Search entries generator.

    class Perl6::Documentable::Search {}

This class takes a L<Perl6::Documentable::Registry|/type/Perl6::Documentable::Registry> and generate
all the necessary entries to enable the search capabilities.

What is an entry? Is a JSON object with three different attributes:

=begin code
{
    "category": "text displayed at the beginning",
    "value": "text displayed just under category",
    "url": "url to the document pointed by the entry"
}
=end code

=head2 method new

Defined as

    method new(:$regsitry)

Creates a new instance of the class.

=head2 method registry

Defined as

    method registry(--> Perl6::Documentable::Registry)

L<Perl6::Documentable::Registry|/type/Perl6::Documentable::Registry> object used to generate the entries.

=head2 method generate-entries

Defined as

    method generate-entries(--> Array[Str])

Generates all search entries and store them in an C<Array>. At this moment, it generates three kind of
entries:

=begin item

B<Primary entries:> this entries comes from L<Perl6::Documentable::Primary|/type/Perl6::Documentable::Primary> objects.
We initialize one entry per instance of that class found in the registry as follows:

=begin code
category => subkind attribute
value    => name attribute
url      => url attribute
=end code

=end item

=begin item

B<Secondary entries:> this entries comes from L<Perl6::Documentable::Secondary|/type/Perl6::Documentable::Secondary> objects.
Before create any entry of this type, we group all C<Perl6::Documentable::Secondary> objects by name and after that,
we generate one entry per group, as follows:

=begin code
category => kind attribute if more than one document is found. Subkind attribute otherwise
value    => name attribute
url      => url attribute
=end code

=end item

=begin item

B<Reference entries:> this entries comes from L<Perl6::Documentable::Index|/type/Perl6::Documentable::Index> objects.
One entry per found object.

=begin code
category => kind attribute (it's always Kind::Reference)
value    => name attribute
url      => url attribute
=end code

=end item

=end pod
